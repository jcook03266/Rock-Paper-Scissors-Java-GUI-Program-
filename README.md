# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Java-GUI-Program-
The following is a GUI program designed around the simple game 'Rock Paper Scissors'.
Multiple counters are present throughout the interface and the button layout is rather compact.
Certain attributes are hidden depending on the current state of the program and revealed later on.
Much of the length regarding this file can be attributed to the actual interface design
with the logic behind the game only taking up a small fraction of the whitespace.

This program is a great way to teach the basics of front end UI design in the realm of Java 
and any other comparable P.L. 

Feel free to fork or reference this project in your own future designs,
cheers!
